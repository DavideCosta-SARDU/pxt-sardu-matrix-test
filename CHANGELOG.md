# Changelog

## 0.8.4 - candidate

- Added a bilingual English/Italian MakeCode tutorial and matching localized help pages.

- Kept runtime code, public signatures, block metadata and behavior unchanged.

## 0.8.3 - 2026-09-07

- Fixed MakeCode Matrix block metadata so code written in JavaScript or Python decompiles with the original matrix instance variable.

## 0.8.2 - candidate

- Added the Micro:Bit proportional font while preserving all existing font enum values and behavior.

## 0.8.1 - candidate

- Added two-color and single-color brightness gradients to edge-based scrolling text.

## 0.8.0 - candidate

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-01

- Added isolated fade, blink, color-wipe, static rainbow, animated rainbow and sparkle effects.
- Added explicit leave, restore and clear final states plus cooperative interruption for animated effects.
- Made blink and rainbow operate on existing content without increasing its brightness; added selectable wipe origins and opposed two-color wipes.
- Added a default effect-color brightness of 128 for fade targets, wipes and sparkles.
- Added a selectable X/Y meeting coordinate and whole-matrix/content-mask mode to opposed wipes.
- Made secondary effect parameters expandable to keep block labels compact and documented Micro:Bit V2 as the recommended effects platform.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-01

- Added static line, rectangle, filled rectangle, circle and filled circle blocks with clipping.
- Added queued scrolling geometry and text composition with a single `start scrolling` block.
- Reordered the toolbox into Creation, Display, Static text, Scrolling text, Static geometry, Scrolling geometry, Pixels and Colors; Graphics remains last under advanced blocks.
- Changed the default brightness of text blocks to 128 while preserving explicit brightness control.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-08-31

- Fixed native graphic blocks using a Matrix variable shadow, preventing the advanced toolbox flyout from failing during rendering.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-08-31

- Fixed the advanced `... more` toolbox by removing the reserved `More` group and assigning advanced blocks to their functional groups.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-31

- Moved native graphics to MakeCode's official advanced `... more` subcategory and made the six grids draw directly into the matrix buffer.
- Removed the six temporary white presets and the obsolete runtime SMG1 selector while retaining the standalone web editor.
- Added compact transparent/color selectors with accessible labels and block help text.
- Compressed accented-font lookup data without changing glyph behavior, restoring successful Micro:Bit V1 test compilation.
- Added the Microsoft approval assets: 300×200 `icon.png`, root `LICENSE.txt` and a compiling `test.ts`.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-31

- Replaced verbose transparent reporter blocks with compact, directly clickable native pixel selectors.
- Added an explicit hollow transparent symbol and separate visible selectors for black and fifteen RGB palette choices.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-31

- Added native MakeCode graphic blocks for all six supported matrix formats, using Pasalt-style rows of selectable cells.
- Added explicit transparent cells and real RGB colors, including black, while retaining overlay and replace-area behavior.
- Reused the existing compact SMG1 graphic representation so native and web-authored graphics share the same renderer.
- Removed the external-editor button from the normal MakeCode flow; the standalone web editor remains available as an optional development and preset-authoring tool.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-31

- Corrected the Display order to show, clear matrix, then interrupt and clear matrix.
- Moved clear-columns and clear-rows to the advanced `... more` toolbox.
- Prioritized edge-based scrolling and changed manual scrolling's default X position from a fixed 16 to the actual matrix width.
- Added the official MakeCode editor-extension protocol to the six-format graphic editor while retaining standalone use.
- Added the graphic-editor manifest entry; public MakeCode now exposes its button, while opening the external iframe remains subject to Microsoft URL approval.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-30

- Added the standalone six-format graphic editor, RGB simulator page and GitHub Pages publication workflow without attaching them to the PXT toolbox manifest.
- Added the Graphics and simulator guides, including the Microsoft approval boundary for automatic MakeCode integration.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-30

- Moved the Display blocks directly after Creation and added inclusive clear-columns, clear-rows and advanced clear-area operations.
- Added compact graphics for all six supported matrix formats: 8×8, 16×16, 32×8, 8×32, 16×8 and 8×16.
- Added separate transparent and black pixels with overlay and replace-area drawing modes.
- Added six built-in graphic presets so the Graphics block selector is always populated in MakeCode.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-30

- Added direct-size and preset-module creation methods with a one-module 16×16 default.
